* ## Machine Learning 
  * [Portugal Bank Marketing Campaign](https://github.com/arun2728/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/Portugal%20Bank%20Marketing%20Campaign) - In this project, we will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from customers of portugal bank. A model trained on this data that is seen as a good fit could then be used to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit or not.
  * [Credit Card Customers Segmentation](https://github.com/arun2728/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/Customer%20Segmentation) - In this project, we need to extract segments of customers depending on their behaviour patterns provided in the dataset, to focus marketing strategy of the company on a particular segment. The aim of this analysis is to group credit card holders in appropriate groups to better understand their needs and behaviors and to serve them better with appropriate marketing offers.
