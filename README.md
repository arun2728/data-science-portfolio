  * [Portugal Bank Marketing Campaign](https://github.com/arun2728/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/Portugal%20Bank%20Marketing%20Campaign): In this project, we will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from customers of portugal bank. A model trained on this data that is seen as a good fit could then be used to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit or not.
